KubeTerminal is helper tool for Kubernetes. The idea is provide a simple and quick tool to get the basics out of Kubernetes environment. 

KubeTerminal is complementing, not replacing, existing kubectl and shell.

Features include (and more planned):

* Uses the shell and kubectl-command.
* List pods in namespace and/or node.
* List services, secrets and other resources in namespace.
* See pod logs.
* Describe pods.
** Get YAML and JSON descriptions.
** Get labels.
* Execute command in a pod.
* View configmaps and secrets.
** Decode base64 values.
** Use openssl to view secret values that are TLS certificates.
* Option for single executable, for easy installation.
* Colors, if terminal supports them.

== Executable binary

Executable binary is used to provide easy way to distribute KubeTerminal to servers without Internet connection.
https://www.pyinstaller.org[PyInstaller] can be to create the executable

Binary is created on system where you want to use the binary. For Windows binary, create the binary in Windows, for Linux, create the binary in Linux, and so on.

=== Docker

DockerHub has image _kazhar/kubeterminal_ and it includes Linux executable:

Use following commands to copy the executable to local machine:

----
docker create -it --name kubeterminal kazhar/kubeterminal bash
docker cp kubeterminal:/kubeterminal kubeterminal.bin
docker rm -fv kubeterminal
----

Or use script: `get_latest_linux_binary.sh`

=== Create binary

Use the following commands create binary in the platform you are using:

* Install PyInstaller
** `pip install pyinstaller`
* Create single file executable:
** `pyinstaller --onefile kubeterminal.py`
* Binary file is located:
** `dist/kubeterminal`
** if building on Windows, file has _.exe_ suffix.

Or, to create Linux executable using Docker:

* Execute script:
** `create_linux_exe.sh`
* The executable is copied current directory.
* Executable name:
** `kubeterminal.bin`

== Background

I'm working with Kubernetes quite a lot and I found that there a few basic commands that I use very, very often. For example:

* `kubectl get pods`
* `kubectl logs <pod name>`
* `kubectl describe pod <pod name>`

Writing these commands take time, and when in hurry, that time is noticeable. 

I accidentally found https://github.com/astefanutti/kubebox[Kubebox] and immediately tried it. 
But authentication failed when using Kubernetes with self-signed certificate.

Kubebox idea haunted until I remembered the existence of https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit[Python Prompt Toolkit] and remembered that it can be used to create full-screen terminal application. 

I decided to make my own Kubebox, and I named it KubeTerminal :-)
